                <h4>5. Contest and Participation Rules</h4>

                <p>
                  <b>Game of Skill</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                BettDraft contests are based on skill and require entrants to use their knowledge of relevant professional sports information and fantasy sports rules to accumulate fantasy points and other player based statistics.  The winners of each contest are determined by the criteria stated in the rules of that specific contest. Fantasy points and statistics are earned by the performance of individual athletes in sporting events. The individuals who use their skill and knowledge of relevant sports information and fantasy sports rules to achieve a winning result according to the scoring rules for that contest are declared winners. BettDraft contests are not games of chance, but rather games of skill. It is prohibited to use our Services for any form of gambling, sports betting or any game of chance.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <b>Entry fees</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                Participation in BettDraft contests requires an entry fee in either US Dollars or Free Play Points. The fee will be deducted from your BettDraft account upon opting to participate in a contest. The fee to enter a contest will vary from contest to contest. For some contests, the fee can be decided by the player and the fee will determine the amount the player can win from the prize pool. All contest entries are final. By submitting an entry to a contest, you agree that you have made an active decision to participate in the contest and that you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions and contest rules. Contest entries are non-refundable. By entering a contest, you agree not to seek to obtain a refund or return of your entry fee for any reason.
                </p>

                <p>
                In the situation where you have selected players in an event that is cancelled entirely, you may be entitled to an entry fee refund depending on the contest rules. Under these circumstances, BettDraft will return your entry fee and cancel your entry into the contest.
                </p>

                <p>
                  <b>Prizes</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                Once a contest is completed, winners are announced, usually within an hour of the completion of the game from the last active player on their team or within an hour of the last game of which players can be selected for the contest. Winners can be notified as much as one day later subject to final verification. To be eligible for prizes, participants must comply with applicable rules for the contest, the House Rules and this Agreement. Prizes are added to the winner's account balance, and in case of a tie, the prize is divided equally among the tied participants, unless stated otherwise in the contest rules.
                </p>

                <p>
                BettDraft offers different types of contests with entry fees and prizes. Prize calculations are based on the entry fee and results at the time of final scoring by BettDraft. Official adjustments made by professional leagues more than 30 mins after the end of the event may not be taken into consideration. BettDraft reserves the right to make adjustments based official stat adjustments, on transmission errors or calculation errors. BettDraft will not delay prize awards or payments in anticipation of any adjustments but may reverse payments if an adjustment changes the initial winning or losing result. Participants are expected to cooperate with efforts to reverse payments if account balances do not allow for the reversal of the initial prize payment.
                </p>

                <p>
                Substitution or transfer of prizes is not allowed, and any taxes associated with the receipt or use of any prize are the sole responsibility of the winner. If the awarding of any prizes is challenged by legal authorities, BettDraft reserves the right to determine whether to award, remove or adjust such prizes at its sole discretion. In all disputes over determining winners of BettDraft contests, BettDraft Inc acts as the sole judge and its decisions are final and binding.
                </p>

                <p>
                Prizes won with Free Play Points have no monetary value. Points may be exchanged for bonus cash at BettDraft’s discretion and BettDraft has no obligation to exchange points for cash, bonus cash, vouchers, or any item of monetary value. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  <b>Cancelation and Adjustments</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                Completion of a Contest is necessary for a prize to be awarded. We reserve the right to cancel any contest at any time. In certain circumstances, where a sporting event is cancelled in which players were selected for a contest, BettDraft may cancel entries containing such players or may cancel the contest entirely. In such instances, entry fees will be refunded to entrants unless otherwise stated in the contest Terms and Conditions.
                </p>

                <p>
                The announcement of winners occurs after the conclusion of each contest, typically within an hour, but can be as long as the following day, and remains subject to final verification. Upon the awarding of prizes and notification of winners, the scoring results will usually remain unchanged. In the event of any official adjustments made by professional leagues, BettDraft may update the results at its sole discretion. However, we reserve the right to adjust results based on transmission errors or irregularities in the information we receive from our stats provider or in our calculation of results. Any adjustments applied may result in the change in the outcome of a contest and the reversal and reissuing of prizes. 
                </p>

                <p>
                  <b>Bonuses and Promotions</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                At BettDraft, we often provide Bonuses or Free Play Points to newly depositing and existing users or for promotional purposes. Bonuses and Free Play Points may be added to a players account at the discretion of BettDraft. If any unused Bonuses remains in the user's account after 30 days of being credited, BettDraft reserves the right to remove them and determine these funds null and void. Free Play Points may be removed after 7 days. Bonuses offered are subject to an expiry date and must be used prior to this date or they will expire and automatically be removed from the player’s account. Bonus funds are solely for entering BettDraft contests and cannot be withdrawn. All bonus funds and Free Play Points have no monetary value. Any winnings from contests entered with bonus funds are considered cash and are fully withdrawable.
                </p>

                <p>
                If a player immediately withdraws funds after receiving a deposit bonus, the bonus may be retracted. If BettDraft determines that a user has abused the bonus system, their bonuses may be retracted and they may no longer be offered bonuses by BettDraft.
                </p>

                <p>
                BettDraft Points, also known as Free Play Points, are for promotional purposes and issued at our sole discretion, subject to the terms of the promotion. Free Play Points have no monetary value and can only be used to enter Free Play contests. Once a player has accumulated enough Free Play points, that have been won from Free Play contests, they can convert these into Bonus Cash. Conversion rates, minimums and exchange rates may vary, and points are converted at the sole discretion of BettDraft.

                BettDraft makes every effort to ensure the accuracy and timeliness of scoring and stat updates applied to all Contests. However, BettDraft does not guarantee the accuracy of any scoring or stat corrections. Official scores and results will be posted at the conclusion of the sporting event or competition once it has been declared official, and all official box scores and statistics are posted. BettDraft may not retroactively apply any stat corrections posted by either BettDraft's third-party data provider or the official league statistic provider more than thirty (30) minutes following the official conclusion of the sporting event or competition. Such corrections may not be taken into consideration for determining how to score the Contest.

                <p>
                12.6 All disputes arising out of or related to third-party payment vendor services involving an Player shall be resolved through arbitration under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association, and any judgment rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court with jurisdiction. The arbitration will be conducted in English, in accordance with the United States Arbitration Act, and a single arbitrator will be selected in accordance with said rules. The arbitrator will render a decision in accordance with the substantive laws of the State, and the award will be accompanied by a statement of the reasons for the decision. Any arbitration shall proceed on an individual basis only and not as a class action or a representative action. Claims may not be joined or consolidated unless all parties agree to such consolidation in writing. No award or decision will have any preclusive effect on any issues or claims in any dispute with anyone who is not a named party to the arbitration.

                  You accept and acknowledge that third-party sources may determine the outcomes of events and games, which may be provided through multiple and/or third-party systems and services necessary for the Services. In the event that the result shown on the Software (as installed and operated by Your hardware) differs from the result shown on our server, the result shown on our server shall always take precedence.

You understand and agree that BettDraft records shall be the ultimate authority in determining the outcomes of events and games, without prejudice to any of Your other rights or remedies. 
                  </p>

                <p>
                This Agreement will become effective upon the completion of the initial registration process and will continue to be in effect as long as BettDraft decides to offer its services and as updated by BettDraft from time to time, unless deactivated according to its terms. BettDraft can deactivate this Agreement and your account (including your username and password) at any time and without prior notice in the following cases: 
                </p>

                <p>
                  <li>
                  BettDraft decides, for any reason, to discontinue providing Services in general or specifically to you;
                  </li><br/>

                  <li>
                  BettDraft believes you have violated any terms of this Agreement or any Additional Rules; 
                  </li><br/>

                  <li>
                  you have used the Services improperly, abusively or breached this Agreement or any Additional Rules; 
                  </li><br/>

                  <li>
                  your account is related to an existing account that has been deactivated, or it is related to inactived accounts; 
                  </li><br/>

                  <li>
                  the appropriate law enforcement agency or regulatory body orders BettDraft to do so;
                  </li><br/>

                  <li>
                  or for any other reason BettDraft determines at its sole discretion. 
                  </li><br/>
                </p>

                <p>
                Upon termination of this Agreement, any balance in your account to which you are entitled will be returned to you within a reasonable time of your request, subject to BettDraft’s right to deduct any amounts owed by you to BettDraft, unless otherwise provided herein or as required by law, rule or regulation.
                </p>  

                <p>
                You may deactivate this Agreement and your account (including your username and password) at any time by sending an email to support@BettDraft.com. The deactivation will take effect upon BettDraft deactivating your account (including your username and password), but you will remain responsible for any activity on your account after sending the email requesting termination of your account by BettDraft. You may request withdrawal of funds from your account whether it is open or closed. BettDraft will honor any customer request to withdraw funds by the later of five days after receipt of the request or 10 days after submission of any tax reporting paperwork required by law unless BettDraft believes in good faith that you have engaged in fraudulent conduct or other conduct that would put BettDraft in violation of any regulatory obligation. If winnings are awarded to you with a closed account, those winnings, to the extent that the winnings consist of funds, will be distributed by BettDraft within seven days, except if an account is closed on the basis of BettDraft’s good faith belief after investigation that you have engaged in fraud or have attempted to engage in behavior that would put BettDraft in violation of any regulatory obligation, in which case such winnings may be withheld, provided that the winnings are redistributed in a manner that reflects the outcome that would have resulted had you not participated.
                </p>

                <p>
                On termination of this Agreement, you shall discontinue the use of the Services, Online Software, or App Software; pay all amounts due and owing to BettDraft; and remove and permanently delete the Software from your computer equipment and/or mobile device and destroy all related documentation in your possession, custody, power or control. The right to deactivate this Agreement by either party shall not prejudice any other right or remedy of either party in respect of the breach concerned (if any) or any other breach. Upon termination of this Agreement, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement and subject to any rights or obligations that have accrued prior to termination, neither party shall have any further obligation to the other party under this Agreement. In addition to terminating your access to the Services and/or blocking your account, BettDraft reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to prevent you from accessing the Services, the Online Software, or App Software, and any of BettDraft’s other websites or servers, and you shall have no claims against BettDraft in such regard.

                If you have previously excluded yourself from our responsible gaming program or any other gaming site, including any brands under our Company or state-sponsored programs, it is your responsibility to avoid creating new accounts during your exclusion period.

Neither BettDraft nor its Affiliates are required to reimburse any funds that you may have used to enter a contest or won through such an account. You are responsible for indemnifying and protecting BettDraft from all claims, demands, liabilities, damages, losses, costs, and expenses, including legal fees and other expenses, resulting from your failure to follow the self-exclusion.

                  <p>
                  In the event of an Player disconnection from the network server while using the Services, the Online Software, or App Software, the following provisions apply:
                  </p>

                  <p>
                    <li>
                      If no Player input is required to complete the contest entry and the contest entry is accepted by the Software and BettDraft, the Software and BettDraft's records will determine the acceptance of the contest entry. Upon reconnection, the contest entry will be reflected in the Player's account history.
                    </li><br/>

                    <li>
                    If Player input is required to complete the contest entry and the contest entry is not accepted by the Software and BettDraft, the Software will not record the contest entry. Upon reconnection, the Player can continue to use the Software and provide the necessary input to contest entry, but the contest entry may not be at the same state as prior to the disconnection.
                    </li><br/>

                    <li>
                    If, at the start of entering a contest, the Location Service verifies the Player's physical presence in the Authorized Gaming Jurisdiction, but fails to verify the Player's continued physical presence at a later point in the gaming session, the Software and BettDraft's records will determine the acceptance of the contest entry at the time of the subsequent failed location verification.
                    </li><br/>
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  You acknowledge and agree that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary, (i) BettDraft and its records will make the final determination regarding any contest activity, including but not limited to, whether a contest entry was placed, stats, fantasy points, and players listed and (ii) BettDraft cannot be held, and you shall not hold BettDraft, liable for any failure of equipment, technology or services, regardless of their physical location or provider, which prevents the placement or acceptance of contest entries or contact with BettDraft.
                  </p>

                  <h4>22. Errors and Potential Errors</h4>

                  <p>
                  BettDraft makes every effort to prevent errors from occurring in relation to contests, which include but are not limited to events, markets, stats, fantasy points, players, teams, entries, acceptance, grading and settlement, and the crediting or debiting of funds to accounts. However, errors may occur due to human, software, and/or system errors, bugs or defects, conflicts or failures of any software or system to operate in accordance with the rules of the relevant event, enrty, product, or service, communication, timing, or display errors, changes in any applicable law, regulations, rules, decisions or policies of a government or sporting agency or body, or any other errors or failures that may arise.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  In the event that errors do arise, you acknowledge, understand, and agree that BettDraft has the right to take corrective action, which may include the cancellation, voiding, or refunding of any contest entries or winnings and the crediting or debiting of your account to resolve the error. You agree to cooperate with BettDraft in resolving any errors or potential errors and returning any funds or winnings that may have been paid to you as a result of such errors or potential errors, including BettDraft reclaiming such funds or winnings from your account. BettDraft reserves the right to correct or otherwise resolve any error or potential error in its sole discretion.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  For instance, if an error or potential error occurs in the transmission of stats or fantasy points, contest entries will be settled with the correct stats at the time of acceptance as determined by BettDraft. If BettDraft accepts a contest entries on an event where offering contest entries on the event itself was in error or otherwise not permitted, BettDraft may void the contest entry entirely, reverse any winnings credited to your account that are related to such voided entry, and return to you the amount you initially entered a contest.
                  </p>

                  <p>
                  It is your responsibility to immediately notify BettDraft and to cooperate with BettDraft in resolving any error or potential error related to your contest entries or account activity. If you have used or withdrawn any funds that have been credited or awarded to your account as a result of an error, including the use of such funds for the placement of contest entries, you agree that BettDraft may cancel such contest entries and/or withhold any winnings from such contest entries. You also agree to hold any funds credited to your account from such contest entries in trust for BettDraft and return such funds to BettDraft upon demand for payment by BettDraft.
                  </p>
