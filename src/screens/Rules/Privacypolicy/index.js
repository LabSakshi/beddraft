                  <b>Automatically Collected Information Through Your Use of the Services :</b><br/>

                  While you use our Services, we may gather certain demographic data and information about your interaction history, devices, IP address, operating system, browser type, browsing behavior and patterns, using automatic data collection technologies. This information is statistical in nature and does not include personal information, but we may retain it or associate it with personal information we gather through other methods. We use this information to enhance our Services and provide a better and more customized service. It allows us to estimate our audience size and usage patterns, store information about your preferences, and identify you when you revisit our Services.
                  </p>

                  <p>The automatic data collection technologies we use may include:</p>

                  <p>
                    <li>
                    Cookies (or browser cookies). BettDraft uses cookies on its Services. A cookie is a small file placed on your device's hard drive or internal storage. We use cookies to track and report on your activity on the Site or App. Through cookies, we can gather data that we use to improve the Services, keep track of return visits to our website, collect and report on aggregate statistical data, authenticate your login credentials, or manage multiple instances of the Site in a single browser. We may also collect other data, such as the page or site that referred you to the Site, the date and time of your visit, and your current IP address. You can reject browser cookies by enabling the appropriate setting in your browser. However, if you do so, you may not be able to access certain parts of our Site, or the Services and functionality may be limited.

                    <li>
                    Our Site and e-mails may contain small electronic files known as web beacons (also referred to as clear gifs, pixel tags, and single-pixel gifs) that permit us to count users who have visited those pages or opened an email and for other related website statistics. Occasionally, we connect personal information to information gathered in our log files to improve our Site and Services.

                    <li>
                    Heat mapping services are used on our Site to display the areas of a page where Players most frequently move the mouse or click. This shows where the points of interest are. These services make it possible to monitor and analyze web traffic and keep track of Player behavior. Some of these services may record sessions and make them available for later visual playback.
                    </li><br/>
                    <li>
                    Our Services collect real-time information about the location of your device. Disabling location data or falsifying your location will impair the functions of Services, including prohibiting you from entering contests, depositing and withdrawing funds.
